RELEASE DATE - Aiming for 1 November 2019. I expect it will be live at Virtualpairprogrammers.com on that date, and maybe a few days after that at Udemy.com (they spend a few days doing their checking). Estimated runtime is about 10 hours.

Warning - there's no Istio in this repo (at least yet); sorry to disappoint. I'm using this as a small sample project to demonstrate Istio's features. I'm developing the course for VirtualPairProgrammers.com, Udemy and maybe others

The aim is to allow the system to run smoothly even on minikube (4Gb required), and to allow enough space to run a service mesh alongside.
